      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p className="sc-sub">
        A free daily forecasting game on the Slovenian day-ahead electricity market. No purchase necessary — ever.

          <h2 className="sc-how-h">THE DAILY QUESTION</h2>
          <p>
            Every day, one question: <b>how big will tomorrow&apos;s electricity price swing be?</b> The swing is the
            gap between the day&apos;s highest and lowest hourly price on Slovenia&apos;s electricity market, in €/MWh.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: 10 }}>
            You pick one of five bands, from Calm to Wild. Bands adjust every Monday to recent prices, so each one
            is roughly a 20% chance — your edge is reading the weather, sunshine and demand. Pure skill.

            <li><b>10 points</b> for the correct band.</li>
            <li>Streak multiplier: ×1.5 on day 2, growing to a <b>×3 cap</b> from day 5. Wrong pick or skipped day resets it.</li>
            <li>Optional exact-spread guess is the <b>tiebreaker</b> — lowest cumulative absolute error wins ties.</li>

          <p>
            A <b>$500 RLUSD prize pool</b> is split across the top 10 of the season leaderboard and paid out on
            XRPL (receiving RLUSD needs a trustline — one more real on-chain step). Prizes are promotional awards
            from the sponsoring entity. They are never a return on a payment, because there is no payment: entry is
            free in every configuration and the platform has no way to accept money from players.

            <li>Settlement uses the officially published day-ahead prices (ENTSO-E A44, SI zone) — final, no discretion.</li>
            <li>Since the market moved to 15-minute products, published values are aggregated to hourly means before computing the spread. Negative prices are handled naturally by max − min.</li>
            <li>Every delivery day&apos;s raw values, aggregation, spread, band and commit-reveal record are public in the archive.</li>
